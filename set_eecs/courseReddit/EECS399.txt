Independent study does not count for ULCS. (It can count towards FlexTech if you're in engineering or general electives though.)

The way independent study works is that you find a professor who agrees to supervise your independent study. You'd work with them to determine what the independent study entails and sign up for the section specific to that professor. Typically, you'd meet with the professor regularly over the semester, you do the agreed upon work (supposed to be 3-4 hours a week per credit), and they assign you a grade at the end.

Supervising an independent study is basically unpaid work for a professor, so there would need to be some other motivating reason for them to agree to it, e.g. you're working on one of their research projects.
I haven’t done direct study in EECS. But I did do some at SI. You don’t “enroll” in this type of classes. You asked a professor to work on a project , and that professor would let someone in the department send you an email to enroll the class. 


In terms of what you do. It depends. Often time it’s just research work. My professor did have some sort syllabus but it’s basically just an outline of the research work we talked about. 

So in short, this is not technically a “class” but a way for professor to “pay” students to do research instead of free work.
I suggest checking out the University of Michigan Office of Research website ([https://www.research.umich.edu/research-u-m/office-research](https://www.research.umich.edu/research-u-m/office-research)). There are lots of resources ([https://research.umich.edu/resources](https://research.umich.edu/resources)) and a phone number (734-764-1185). CoE has research resources too ([https://www.engin.umich.edu/research/](https://www.engin.umich.edu/research/)).
Do you have any work study money?

EDIT: in physics at least it’s research for credit or pay. Idk how it works for CS tho
