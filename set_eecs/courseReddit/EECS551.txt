Im taking 458, 461, 551, and 516. Not exactly the same, but I'm thinking of dropping 516.

EECS 505 is one of those courses that you should take if you have the time to kill. It's a moderate to heavy amount of work depending on the topic of that week. I liked the class a lot but I don't think the workload is justified by what it teaches you. It's mostly implementing various models of ML in a guided online notebook using Julia (NOT python or Matlab). It's really a fantastic course for graduate students whose primary area of study is not CS or ML. I felt that it didn't go deep enough into either the math or the programming part of machine learning, but for me it kind of worked well. 

If you're a CS student, you'd be better served by the more project-heavy EECS 445. If you're a graduate student in signal/image processing or ML, you should probably be in EECS 551 instead, which is supposed to be a very similar class but tailored specifically toward that major.

It's a very new course, only in its third semester. It was a special topics course for a year before last fall I think. 551 is not a new course but I don't know if/how undergraduates can register for it (and a lot of CS undergrads seem to be driven away by alternative languages like Matlab or Julia ðŸ˜ƒ).

At least for 551, fill out the override request on the ECE website. I am pretty sure they said they will issue an override if you are SIPML and on the waitlist.
EECS 402
The one you have the strongest interest in
