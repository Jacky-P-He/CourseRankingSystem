No IOE classes are offered. I've only ever heard of EECS (and maybe MechE?) offering undergrad spring/summer classes in the CoE. 

Talk to your department advisor. They'll know what's available and what your options are. 
There is one 400 level IOE project management course offered abroad in France.
