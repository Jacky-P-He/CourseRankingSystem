I'm in it right now. There are no homeworks or exams, just three projects and occasional quizzes. Prof is super anal and very research y in a way of like, "why would you use an IMU to figure out where the robot is instead of pointing a camera at the ceiling and tracking the ceiling tiles." The class website with all project descriptions and past projects can be found at https://wiki2.eecs.umich.edu/hrb/index.php/Hands-On_Robotics . You have to put in many hours a week for group meetings to build your robot. Allegedly everyone gets an A, but tbd on that.
