Are you an undergraduate? If so, any reason why you'd want to take 586 over 477? 477 is a fall class though so it makes sense if it doesn't work for your scheduling.

From what I know the material is similar and I haven't heard anyone recommend the graduate course instead, whereas for example 445 and 545 are different enough to warrant the graduate level one. 477 is plenty rigorous and challenging already, so you can take that instead if you just want a serious algorithms class.
